- **1b)**
Work (Total computational steps): O(V + E)
- where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. Since rthe alogrithm is visiting each vertex and edge once during the BFS traversal the work would be this, 
Span (Critical path length): O(V + E)
- The critical path length corresponds to the  chain of  operations in the BFS traversal, which covers visiting all vertices and edges. this is the worst case for span since we have to take account that there is always a worst case to get to the node 



- **2b)**
tested the code
